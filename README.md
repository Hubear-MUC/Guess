Version 3.1:

Restructured the code a little to make it more readable and maintainable


Version 3.0:

Replaced the dice()- Function by the usage of a class due to usage of GGE 0.4 in this game.

This was necessary because it was not possible to compile when stand alone functions and classes were used together. This issue is to be resolved to regain backward compatiblility to GGE 0.3, however GGE is supposed to be designed as a collection of classes so the introduction of classes was more important.


Version 2.0:

- The number that is to guess is a calculated random number, not a hardcoded
  one anymore as it was before.

- First serious use of the GGE- engine (Version 0.2)


Version 1.0
